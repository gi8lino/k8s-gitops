# Remove user accounts that match either of these conditions:

# Last login was more than 6 months ago, and the account has no checks. Assume the user doesn't intend to use the account any more and would probably want it removed.

# Remove old objects from external object storage. When an user removes a check, removes a project, or closes their account,
# Healthchecks does not remove the associated objects from the external object storage on the fly.
# Instead, you should run pruneobjects occasionally (for example, once a month). This command first takes an inventory of all checks in the database,
# and then iterates over top-level keys in the object storage bucket, and deletes any that don't also exist in the database.
